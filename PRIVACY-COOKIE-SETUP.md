## 🎯 How It Works

### First Visit
1. User lands on your site
2. Cookie banner appears at bottom
3. Google Analytics **does NOT load** until consent given
4. User chooses:
   - **Accept All** → GA loads, tracking starts
   - **Reject Non-Essential** → Only essential cookies, no tracking

### Return Visits
- Banner doesn't show (choice remembered)
- If user accepted: GA loads automatically
- If user rejected: No tracking

### Changing Preferences
- User clicks "Cookie Settings" in footer
- Banner reappears
- User can change their choice

---

## 🔧 Configuration Needed

### Update Google Analytics ID
In `index.html`, find line **1296** and replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX`:

```javascript
gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX', {
    'anonymize_ip': true,
    'cookie_flags': 'SameSite=None;Secure'
});
```

**Also update line 46** (the original GA script tag).

### Update Privacy Policy Email
In `privacy-policy.html`, replace `privacy@chewieai.com` with your actual email:
- Lines with contact information
- "Contact Us" section

### Update Domain References
In `privacy-policy.html`, replace `chewieai.com` with your actual domain if different.

```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Cookie Banner

- ✅ **Secure flag** - HTTPS only (when deployed)
- ✅ **1-year expiry** - Reasonable consent duration

### Google Analytics

## 📊 Analytics After Consent

Once user accepts cookies, Google Analytics tracks:

- ✅ Session duration
- ✅ Traffic sources
- ✅ User demographics (anonymized)
- ✅ Device & browser info
- ✅ Geographic location (city-level)

**Not tracked if user rejects:**
- ❌ No analytics cookies
- ❌ No user tracking
- ❌ Only essential site functionality

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Banner doesn't appear
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Clear cookies and try again

### GA still loads without consent
- Check line 46-51 in `index.html`
- Ensure GA script is ONLY in the `initGoogleAnalytics()` function
- Remove any duplicate GA scripts

### Banner appears every time
- Check if cookies are being blocked by browser
- Verify cookie is being set (DevTools → Application → Cookies)
- Check for cookie domain mismatch

### Privacy policy link broken
- Ensure `privacy-policy.html` is in the same directory as `index.html`
- Check file name spelling (case-sensitive on some servers)
