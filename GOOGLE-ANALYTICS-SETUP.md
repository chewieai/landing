<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

**After (example):**
```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ABC123XYZ"></script>
<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
